TODO:

- Add opening a transaction to DatabaseConnection class
- Revise getters and setters to ensure that fields remain null until set intentionally. Automatically setting LastLoginTime is not desirable.
- Decide if we will reference users by id or by name. Already username must be unique, but id still feels more safe given that it is generated by the database.
- Decide how to deal with text formatting from client. Save as HTML tags? But then if we do that, there is still the question of how to save in database. Varchar?
- DBContext should be injected into each service instead of creating new objects like a retard. 
 
Room Functionality:
 
From friend view: clicking on a friend should "open" the private room.
   if room exists - return room
   if not exists - create room, then return room
    
From room view: the user should be able to see how many users are in the room (private flag?)
    thus simple, just return room
    
MISC:

Honestly, ef core is pretty retarded considering I'm trying to control the DB exactly as I want it. Try Dapper?
What a wild waste of time that would have been... maybe keep going, but try to actually learn it? For sure
you aren't forced into stupid DB schemas... Anyway, lots of places use it, I will have to learn it eventually...
