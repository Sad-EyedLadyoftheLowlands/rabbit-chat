TODO:

- Add opening a transaction to DatabaseConnection class
- Revise getters and setters to ensure that fields remain null until set intentionally. Automatically setting LastLoginTime is not desirable.
- Decide if we will reference users by id or by name. Already username must be unique, but id still feels more safe given that it is generated by the database.
- Decide how to deal with text formatting from client. Save as HTML tags? But then if we do that, there is still the question of how to save in database. Varchar?
